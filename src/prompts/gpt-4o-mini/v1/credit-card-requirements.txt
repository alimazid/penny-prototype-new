- Common Dominican banks: BHD León, Banco Popular, Banreservas, APAP, Qik, Banco Caribe, Banco Santa Cruz
- Bank may appear as "BHD", "Popular", "Reservas", etc.

Card Processor Extraction Patterns:
- Look for: "Visa", "Mastercard", "MasterCard", "American Express", "AMEX", "Discover"
- May appear as logos or text in email body
- Sometimes appears with card number like "Visa ***1234"

If any of the required fields cannot be extracted with reasonable confidence, set confidence to 0.3 or lower but still attempt extraction.
